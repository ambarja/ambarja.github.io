# Quarto Formatting

### Introduction

I decided to start working with Quarto for majority of my writing needs and have been experimenting with its 
various features, formatting and quirks. I am by no means anywhere close to an expert, however, with this write-up I 
hope to help out anyone starting out working with QMD files. This is a few small tips and notes (mostly for me) to use as a reference.

QMD works similar to markdown so basic markdown syntax^[https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/] applies for formatting text.


### Basic Code Formatting 

A lot of Quarto users are coming from RMarkdown, so formatting locations feel familiar and different at the same time.
Code chunks format locations are inside the cells preceded with a `#|`, at the beginning of each
code block.

A simple example of this behavior: 


```{{r}}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: fig-mtcars
#| fig-cap: "Fig. 1 Mpg and hp  of Cars"


library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y=hp)) +
geom_smooth() +
geom_jitter()

```
which generates the following output: 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: fig-mtcars
#| fig-cap: "Mpg and hp  of Cars"


library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y=hp)) +
geom_smooth() +
geom_jitter()

```

Figure caption, code folding are applied from the commands in the first line of the code block.


### Margin Content

In certain situations, be it for aesthetics or to maximize the use of whitespace, 
Quarto allows the user to place content including figures, tables, captions etc on the "margin" area.

The syntax to add a figure to the margin is: 

```default

::: {.column-margin}
![A margin image](image.png)
:::

```
#### Margin Figures & Tables


```{r}
#| column: margin


mtcars[1:6, 1:3]  |> 
gt::gt()  |> gtExtras::gt_theme_538()



```



```{r}
#| column: margin
#| fig-cap: "Mpg and hp  of Cars"
#| label: fig-mtcars3


library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y=hp)) +
geom_smooth() +
geom_jitter()



```

Additionally, captions, comments and text blocks can be added to the margin area in the output. 


### Overflowing Content

To extend the functionality, qmd files also allow us to ignore margins altogether
by adding `column:screen` function to the code chunk. This can result in
great looking articles and blogs by adding functions.

Using screen fill function, here is a map of NYC embedded into the blog.

```{r}
#| column: screen

library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lat=40.7128, lng=-74.0060, popup="NY City")
```

Further, content can be filled partially on the screen. 

```default

::: {..column-screen-left}
:::

```


::: {..column-screen-left}

```{r}
#| column: screen-inset-left


knitr::kable(
  mtcars[1:6, 1:10]
)

```


:::



### Callout Blocks


To draw attention towards something in the text, a block of text call be used as a callout blog in Quarto.

Inline code 

```default
:::{.callout-note}
Note: This is a callout of type `note`
:::

```
renders the following output

:::{.callout-note}
Note: This is a callout of type `note`
:::

Other types of callouts like warning, tip and important are also built in for
multiple types of callout blocks.


:::{.callout-tip}
## Tip With Caption

This is an example of a callout with a caption.

### Acknowledgments

Acknowledgments section can be added to the end of article/text by using the `.appendix` command. 
It will appear at the end of the article/blog with footnotes and citations,etc. formatted as a smaller text font.

```default

## Acknowledgments {.appendix}

This is the sample text for the acknowledgement section. I made use of the Official Quarto documentation to help me with writing this post.
