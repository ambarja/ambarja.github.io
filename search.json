Finding the path is simple, open R and type: R.home(“bin”) and copy the output path.\nAnother somewhat major tweak you would want to do to the editor:\nSome simple shortcuts like the pipe operator doesn’t work out of the box, so adding a shortcut for “%>%” or “|>” depending on your preference can be done using the following method:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/58731362/how-do-i-had-an-alias-for-magrittr-pipe-from-r-in-vscode How do I had an alias for magrittr pipe from R in vscode - Stack Overflow"

A run file button is located at the top of the panel and individual lines of code can be run using the cmd+return shortcut on mac. The shortcut can be easily modified similar to how the pipe operator shortcut is modified above.\nIn terms of running and getting results for plain R code and .R files; VSCode is a great alternative for a lot of people including me. So if you’re like me and you use R mainly for statistical analysis, data visualization and data analysis; give VSCode a try.\nWorking with Notebooks and Rmd:\nThis is where VSCode falls so much behind RStudio it becomes a one horse race. The notebook support in VSCode is in a single word - terrible. Running code chunks in a .Rmd notebook feels and looks dated. My existing notebooks created in RStudio were buggy in VSCode despite not showing any errors in RStudio. Creating new notebooks is unintuitive and still a long way behind RStudio in terms of the overall feel to it.\nI have searched for solutions, including globally installing pandoc, knitr and rmarkdown etc and trying multiple versions of R and the packages mentioned previously to no avail. This is one of the biggest reasons I am not completely switching to VSCode just yet."

I did not do any analysis on the times it took to load a piece of code on one vs the other but VSCode ‘feels’ quicker.\nOne stop shop for R, Python, HTML, CSS, and dozens other languages - and does it much better than RStudio\nMULTIPLE R SESSIONS!!! - Such a great feature when you’re trying to develop several related projects at the same time.\nCode Refactoring - much better than RStudio\nColor picker and color blocksFor people like me who work with a lot of data visualizations, the ability to see the colors and use the color blocks to pick colors seamlessly is a gamechanger.\n\n\n\nLanguage server - document outline - Navigating through a long line of code (and multiple R files) is painless\nIntellisense and Code Completion - faster, more user friendly\n\n\n\nHelp and documentation: Same information, much more streamlined\n\n\n\nLiveshare and working with teams\nCode Snippets are easier to use and set up than RStudio\nMuch easier git and version control integration\nFunctions are handled brilliantly. Hover over them and you get all kinds of information and callbacks.\nCode organization: Code sections allow for folding of code, makes fo easier code reading and naviation and cleaner code overall.\n\n\n\nCustomizable and make it your own by editing the json files inside VSCode.\n\nSo VSCode has some amazing features that could really tempt an RStudio user."

I am by no means anywhere close to an expert, however, with this write-up I hope to help out anyone starting out working with QMD files. This is a few small tips and notes (mostly for me) to use as a reference.\nQMD works similar to markdown so basic markdown syntax1 applies for formatting text.\n\n\n\nA lot of Quarto users are coming from RMarkdown, so formatting locations feel familiar and different at the same time. Code chunks format locations are inside the cells preceded with a #|, at the beginning of each code block.\nA simple example of this behavior:\n```{r}\n#| code-fold: true\n#| label: fig-mtcars\n#| fig-cap: \"Fig. 1 Mpg and hp  of Cars\"\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y=hp)) +\ngeom_smooth() +\ngeom_jitter()\n\n```\nwhich generates the following output:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y=hp)) +\ngeom_smooth() +\ngeom_jitter()\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Mpg and hp of Cars\n\n\n\n\nFigure caption, code folding are applied from the commands in the first line of the code block.\n\n\n\nIn certain situations, be it for aesthetics or to maximize the use of whitespace, Quarto allows the user to place content including figures, tables, captions etc on the “margin” area.\nThe syntax to add a figure to the margin is:\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n![A margin image](image.png)\n:::\n\n\n\nmtcars[1:6, 1:3]  |> \ngt::gt()  |> gtExtras::gt_theme_538()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      mpg\n      cyl\n      disp\n    \n  \n  \n    21.0\n6\n160\n    21.0\n6\n160\n    22.8\n4\n108\n    21.4\n6\n258\n    18.7\n8\n360\n    18.1\n6\n225\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y=hp)) +\ngeom_smooth() +\ngeom_jitter()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Mpg and hp of Cars\n\n\n\nAdditionally, captions, comments and text blocks can be added to the margin area in the output.\n\n\n\n\nTo extend the functionality, qmd files also allow us to ignore margins altogether by adding column:screen function to the code chunk. This can result in great looking articles and blogs by adding functions.\nUsing screen fill function, here is a map of NYC embedded into the blog.\n\nlibrary(leaflet)\nleaflet() %>%\n  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles\n  addMarkers(lat=40.7128, lng=-74.0060, popup=\"NY City\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther, content can be filled partially on the screen.\n\n::: {..column-screen-left}\n:::\n\n\nknitr::kable(\n  mtcars[1:6, 1:10]\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmpg\ncyl\ndisp\nhp\ndrat\nwt\nqsec\nvs\nam\ngear\n\n\n\n\nMazda RX4\n21.0\n6\n160\n110\n3.90\n2.620\n16.46\n0\n1\n4\n\n\nMazda RX4 Wag\n21.0\n6\n160\n110\n3.90\n2.875\n17.02\n0\n1\n4\n\n\nDatsun 710\n22.8\n4\n108\n93\n3.85\n2.320\n18.61\n1\n1\n4\n\n\nHornet 4 Drive\n21.4\n6\n258\n110\n3.08\n3.215\n19.44\n1\n0\n3\n\n\nHornet Sportabout\n18.7\n8\n360\n175\n3.15\n3.440\n17.02\n0\n0\n3\n\n\nValiant\n18.1\n6\n225\n105\n2.76\n3.460\n20.22\n1\n0\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo draw attention towards something in the text, a block of text call be used as a callout blog in Quarto.\nInline code\n:::{.callout-note}\nNote: This is a callout of type `note`\n:::\nrenders the following output\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote: This is a callout of type note\n\n\nOther types of callouts like warning, tip and important are also built in for multiple types of callout blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip With Caption\n\n\n\nThis is an example of a callout with a caption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficial Documents: https://quarto.org/docs/guide/\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments section can be added to the end of article/text by using the .appendix command. It will appear at the end of the article/blog with footnotes and citations,etc. formatted as a smaller text font.\n\n## Acknowledgments {.appendix}\n\nThis is the sample text for the acknowledgement section.
